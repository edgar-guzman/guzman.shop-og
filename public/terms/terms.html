            <p>
                It’s rolling onto 2 years since I went back independent and fully freelance, but
                over the 11+ years I’ve been working in design and the web, I’ve probably done
                around half of that as a freelancer in some capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots of people are experiencing either redundancies or work issues at the moment
                and although, at the time of writing, we are in a global pandemic: now is a great
                time to go freelance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article, I’m going to share with you some tips that have helped me make a
                success out of this freelancing stuff. I hope by the end that you will feel more
                confident about going freelance. I must point out that the advice is mainly
                centered around working with clients, rather than say, doing contract development
                work, but hopefully you’ll get some benefit if that’s you. Let’s dig in.
            </p>

            <h2>Terms of <span class="font-italic">Products</span></h2>
            <p>
                The “F” in Freelance stands for “Freedom”. It doesn’t really, but freedom is
                exactly what you get when you go freelance. This freedom for me has enabled two
                key things: ownership of my time and flexibility to diversify what I do.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went back to freelancing in September 2018 after being made redundant from an
                agency. For at least 12 months after that, I worked in a similar role, as a
                freelancer: working only with clients and contracting for other agencies, along
                with a brief stint of guest-lecturing at the local University. Although the work
                was mostly the same—I even inherited a client from my old job—I worked a lot less
                per week. This is because I didn’t work a “normal” 9-5, but instead worked 10-4
                (roughly). Those hours certainly add up.
            </p>

            <h2>Terms of <span class="font-italic">Copyright</span></h2>
            <p>
                There’s two parts to focus on here: being comfortable talking about money and
                being comfortable with your personal finances.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ll start with talking about money. You <strong>have</strong> to be comfortable
                talking about money with clients. In fact, when a new enquiry lands in my inbox,
                <strong>the first thing I do is ask them what their budget is</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                So much time is wasted by being coy about money. A client needs to have a budget
                to hire you and let me tell you, if they refuse to tell you what that budget is,
                <strong>that’s a massive red flag</strong>. That refusal could be down to mistrust
                on their end, though—they might think you’ll use that budget to send them an
                over-inflated quote. I’d tackle that by saying something like this:
              </p>

              <h2>Terms of <span class="font-italic">Refund</span></h2>
